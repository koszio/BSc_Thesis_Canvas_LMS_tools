# BSc_Thesis_Canvas_tools

These files were a part of the thesis by Shayan Fallahian and Konstantinos Zioris.

Because the thesis utilized several repositories a decision were made to only include the files that were affected in one repositiorr and then refer to each repository.

**chipit.rb** is a part of [Gerald.Q.Maguire's repository E-learning](https://github.com/gqmaguirejr/E-learning).

**diva7.js** is a part of [Gerald.Q.Maguire's repository diva-puppeteer](https://github.com/gqmaguirejr/diva-puppeteer).

**parsingPDF.py** were added to [Shiva Besharat Pour and Qi Li's parsing module](https://github.com/GiantPanda0090/connecting_silos_kththesis_TCOMK_CINTE) under `../polls/src`.

For the files **chipit.rb** and **diva7.js** we refer you to their respective repositories however if you wanna try **parsingPDF.py** then perform following line in an appropriate terminal: `sudo python parsingPDF.py <absolute path to the PDF file>`.
